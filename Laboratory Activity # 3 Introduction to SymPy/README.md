# Laboratory Activity #3  
**Introduction to SymPy**

## Description
This activity introduces symbolic computation using the Python library SymPy. Unlike numerical computation, SymPy manipulates algebraic expressions symbolically, making it ideal for mathematics-related programming tasks.

## Topics Covered
- Defining symbolic variables
- Expression expansion and simplification
- Symbolic differentiation
- Solving algebraic equations

## Purpose
To provide a transition from numerical programming to symbolic mathematics. Students gain experience in how software can manipulate expressions as algebraic symbols rather than numeric values.

## Notable Sections
- Creating and manipulating expressions like `(x + y)**2`
- Differentiating functions with respect to one or more variables
- Solving systems of linear equations symbolically
