# Laboratory Activity #1  
**Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset using Python**

## Description
This activity introduces students to computational thinking by exploring a real-world dataset â€” the Titanic passenger manifest. The notebook demonstrates how data can be represented, manipulated, and analyzed to identify patterns and logical decision-making processes.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to data structures using `pandas`
- Loading and viewing datasets
- Basic data exploration (head, tail, info)
- Concept of features and labels in datasets
- Initial logical reasoning using data (e.g., survival rates)

## Purpose
To develop a foundational mindset for solving problems using data. Students begin thinking like programmers by applying structured steps to break down and analyze information from a dataset.

## Notable Sections
- Loading the Titanic dataset from CSV
- Exploring columns like `Age`, `Survived`, and `Sex`
- Using conditions and filters to answer questions
