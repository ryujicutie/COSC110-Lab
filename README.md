# COSC110 Laboratory Activities

This repository contains compiled Jupyter notebook lab activities for the course **COSC110 - Introduction to Programming**.

Each lab is focused on a different topic, ranging from basic data analysis using the Titanic dataset to symbolic mathematics with SymPy.

## Lab Contents

- [Lab 1 - Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset using Python](./Laboratory%20Activity%20%231%20Computational%20Thinking%20with%20the%20Titanic%20Dataset%20using%20Python/lab1_titanic_Macrohon.ipynb)

- [Lab 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset](./lab2_titanic_Macrohon.ipynb)
- [Lab 3 - Symbolic Mathematics with SymPy](./lab3_sympy_Macrohon.ipynb)
- [Lab 4 - Advanced Symbolic Computation with SymPy](./lab4_sympy_Macrohon.ipynb)

Each notebook contains code and comments that guide students through fundamental programming and data science concepts using Python.
