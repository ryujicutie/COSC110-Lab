# Laboratory Activity #4  
**Exploring Calculus using SymPy**

## Description
This activity focuses on using Python and the SymPy library to explore foundational ideas in calculus — such as limits, derivatives, integrals, and series — in an accessible and beginner-friendly way.

Rather than writing the code from scratch, the emphasis is placed on interpreting pre-written code and understanding the mathematical concepts behind it.

## Topics Explored
- Symbolic limits and how they relate to approaching values
- Derivatives and their role in analyzing change
- Indefinite and definite integrals
- Series expansion to approximate complex functions

## Purpose
To help students develop a conceptual understanding of calculus without diving deep into complex mathematics. The activity builds math intuition by interacting with symbolic outputs in Python.

## Student Task
- Run the provided code snippets
- Observe the symbolic or graphical outputs
- Answer guiding questions about what the output represents
- Explain the reasoning behind each result or interpretation

## Value
This activity bridges the gap between coding and mathematics. It supports the learning of abstract concepts like change, area under curves, and infinite series through visualization and symbolic manipulation.
