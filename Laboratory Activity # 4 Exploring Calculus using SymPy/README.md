# Laboratory Activity #4  
**Exploring Calculus using SymPy**

## Description
This lab advances the use of SymPy by applying it to fundamental calculus topics, including integration, limits, and series expansions. Students learn how to compute symbolic solutions to calculus problems directly in code.

## Topics Covered
- Indefinite and definite integrals
- Series expansions (Taylor/Maclaurin)
- Evaluating limits
- Plotting symbolic functions

## Purpose
To reinforce mathematical concepts in calculus by using symbolic programming tools. This lab emphasizes how programming can support problem-solving in higher-level math.

## Notable Sections
- Performing integration of polynomial and trigonometric functions
- Series approximation of `e^x`, `sin(x)`
- Computing limits for rational expressions
