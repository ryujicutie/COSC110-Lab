# Laboratory Activity #2  
**Data Cleaning and Analysis using the Titanic Dataset**

## Description
This lab builds on the previous activity by introducing data cleaning and more in-depth exploratory data analysis. Students identify and handle missing data, transform data for consistency, and derive insights using visualization and statistical summaries.

## Topics Covered
- Handling missing values (`NaN`)
- Filling or dropping null data
- Data type conversion and column cleanup
- Creating visualizations (bar plots, histograms)
- Correlation analysis between features

## Purpose
To teach the importance of preparing data before analysis. Clean and structured datasets lead to more accurate and meaningful results in data science workflows.

## Notable Sections
- Cleaning `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin` data
- Visualizing survival rate by gender and class
- Understanding feature importance using correlation
